# Acumatica Integration

This directory contains the integration code for connecting CommissionFlow to Acumatica ERP.

## Version Compatibility

**Developed and Tested With:** Acumatica 2025 R1 (25.101.0153.5)

### Important Notes

This integration was built specifically against Acumatica version 2025 R1. Different versions of Acumatica may have:

- **Different field availability** - Some endpoints may not have certain fields (e.g., `Email` on `Salesperson`)
- **Different OData capabilities** - Filter and select query support may vary
- **Different data structures** - Field names, types, or response formats may change
- **Different API behaviors** - Authentication, session management, or endpoint behavior may differ

### Known Version-Specific Issues

1. **Salesperson Email Field**: Not all Acumatica versions include the `Email` field on the Salesperson endpoint. The client includes fallback logic to handle this gracefully.

2. **IsActive Filtering**: Some versions may not support OData filtering on the `IsActive` field. The client attempts multiple strategies:
   - First attempt: `$filter=IsActive eq true` with Email field
   - Second attempt: `$filter=IsActive eq true` without Email field
   - Fallback: Fetch all salespeople and filter locally

3. **API Version Compatibility**: The integration supports API versions from 23.200.001 to 25.100.001, but testing was primarily done on 24.200.001 and 25.100.001.

## Integration Architecture

### Key Components

- **`client.ts`** - Main Acumatica API client with authentication and HTTP methods
- **`types.ts`** - TypeScript type definitions for Acumatica entities
- **`crypto.ts`** - Credential encryption/decryption utilities

### Supported Endpoints

- **Salesperson** - For mapping salespeople to CommissionFlow users
- **SalesInvoice** - For importing sales transactions and calculating commissions
- **Customer** - For customer data synchronization
- **Project** - For project-based commission tracking
- **Branch** - For multi-branch organization support
- **ItemClass** - For product categorization in commission rules

## Testing Against Different Versions

If you need to connect to a different Acumatica version:

1. **Verify Endpoint Availability**
   ```bash
   # Test the Salesperson endpoint
   GET https://your-instance.acumatica.com/entity/Default/25.100.001/Salesperson

   # Check available fields
   GET https://your-instance.acumatica.com/entity/Default/25.100.001/$metadata
   ```

2. **Test OData Queries**
   ```bash
   # Test filtering
   GET https://your-instance.acumatica.com/entity/Default/25.100.001/Salesperson?$filter=IsActive eq true

   # Test field selection
   GET https://your-instance.acumatica.com/entity/Default/25.100.001/Salesperson?$select=SalespersonID,Name,Email
   ```

3. **Verify Authentication**
   - Confirm cookie-based session management works
   - Test login/logout endpoints
   - Verify company selection behavior

4. **Update Type Definitions**
   - If field structures differ, update `types.ts`
   - Add new fallback logic in `client.ts` if needed
   - Update tests to reflect new behavior

## Multi-Tier Fallback Strategy

The integration uses a multi-tier fallback approach to handle version differences gracefully:

```typescript
try {
  // Attempt 1: Best case scenario with all fields
  return await fetchWithAllFields();
} catch (error) {
  // Attempt 2: Fallback without optional fields
  try {
    return await fetchWithReducedFields();
  } catch (retryError) {
    // Attempt 3: Last resort with local filtering
    return await fetchAllAndFilterLocally();
  }
}
```

This ensures the integration continues working even when some features aren't available in the connected Acumatica version.

## Future Considerations

When upgrading or supporting new Acumatica versions:

1. Review Acumatica release notes for API changes
2. Test all endpoints against the new version
3. Update type definitions if data structures changed
4. Add new fallback logic for deprecated features
5. Update the version compatibility documentation
6. Consider maintaining version-specific client variations if differences are significant
